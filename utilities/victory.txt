Running out of the hole, I squinted as the sight of the sun nearly blinded me.
The sound of birds chirping, the rustling of trees.
This... This is freedom.
As I walked through this unfamiliar environment, I thought about the experience I had down in that dungeon.
Never again.
I walked towards the dead tree in the middle of the fields.
It has been a long day.. It is time for some rest.
THE END
