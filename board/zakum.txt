As I enter the room, this giant statue stands tall in front of me.
This is the most diabolical feeling I have felt so far while I have been trapped in this dungeon.
There seems to be light glimmering behind it though, is that the exit?
I move forward when suddenly, the statue starts moving and tries to strike me with a stone slate.
Guess there is only one way out of this.
