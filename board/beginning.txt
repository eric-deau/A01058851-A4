Where am I? This place stinks.
Last I remember was riding the cart...
I remember trying to cross the border..
But then I was ambushed by the Imperial Guard...
This place is dark, I don't recognize anything about this place.
There are 4 doors at each cardinal direction.
I need to remember who I am first...
And then I need to get moving.
