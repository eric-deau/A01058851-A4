As the eyeball drops to the ground, the weight of it starts collapsing the roof.
I run straight into the staircase to get away.
The staircase leads me straight into another room and I lock the door behind me. I don't want anything chasing me out of that collapse.
These rooms all look the same, and I still have no idea where I am. Just have to keep moving forward I guess.
