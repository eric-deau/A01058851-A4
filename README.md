## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
If played on command line, you will have to be more patient with
the printing, as time.sleep does not work properly on CMD. Also do not
press enter too quicky, or else the Quick Time Events might accidentally
register an unwanted action. Play Warrior or Thief to breeze through the
game, and play Mage for a slightly more challenging run. 

Goal: Get to Heaven, and defeat ZAKUM, the cursed statue.

How to play: Use the numbers given by the prompt to perform an action.

(d) minimized scope and lifetime of all variables and objects
(e) decomposition of your idea into a collection of small, atomic, independent, and reusable functions

(g) demonstration of an understanding of how comprehensions work through the meaningful and
correct use of one or more list/dictionary comprehensions

(j) use of the membership operator where it makes sense
(k) appropriate use of the range function
(l) thoughtful and meaningful use of one or more functions from itertools
(m) the random module
(n) function annotations
(o) doctests and/or unit tests for every single function (that is, every function needs doctests or
unit tests or doctests and unit tests).
(p) ALL output must be formatted using f-strings and/or str.format and/or %-formatting
