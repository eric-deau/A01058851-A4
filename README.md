## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
If played on command line, you will have to be more patient with
the printing, as time.sleep does not work properly on CMD. Also do not
press enter too quicky, or else the Quick Time Events might accidentally
register an unwanted action. Play Warrior or Thief to breeze through the
game, and play Mage for a slightly more challenging run. 

Goal: Get to Heaven, and defeat ZAKUM, the cursed statue.

How to play: Use the numbers given by the prompt to perform an action.
